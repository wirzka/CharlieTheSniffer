# CharlieTheSniffer
Charlie The Sniffer is a tool created by me for a university project. It is actually a basic packet sniffer written in very bad C.
## DOCs grabbed from the web
- [Tutorial Spoint for C](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/index.htm)
- [Official website for LibPcap](http://www.tcpdump.org/pcap.html) 
- [LibPcap in C](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/using-libpcap-c)

## Ideas on how to progress in the development
1. Liberty to choose which interface to use, if wlan in -> activate promiscous mode
2. Printing live capture on the terminal
3. Saving the capture on pcap files vs raw txt files (Can it be done?!)
4. Fixed time capture vs. time stopped by key combination
5. Which proto can we sniff by default?
6. Adding filter to sniff specific proto
7. It has to be a cmd line tool, so parsing argument at the beginning is a MUST -> help message is REQUIRED

***Btw, KISS is your best friend.***
